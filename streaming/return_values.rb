# The return value of a route block determines at least the response
# body passed on to the HTTP client, or at least the next middleware
# in the Rack stack. Most commonly, this is a string, as in the above
# examples. But other values are also accepted.
# 
# You can return any object that would either be a valid Rack response,
# Rack body object or HTTP status code:
# 
#   An Array with three elements: 
# 
#     [status (Fixnum), headers (Hash), response body (responds to #each)]
# 
#   An Array with two elements: 
#     [status (Fixnum), response body (responds to #each)]
# 
#   An object that responds to #each and passes nothing but strings to the given block
# 
#   A Fixnum representing the status code
